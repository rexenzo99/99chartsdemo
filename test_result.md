Key improvements confirmed: 1) Uses /token-boosts/latest/v1 endpoint for boosted tokens, 2) Includes current trending tokens (VIRTUAL, SPX, SHIB, ALT, ACT, POPCAT, ZEREBRO, POWELL, DOGE, GOAT, Bonk, Pnut), 3) All pairs have >$10k volume ($11,260-$4.5M range), 4) 48% USDT/USDC pairs, 5) No duplicates, 6) Properly sorted by volume, 7) Multi-chain support (Solana: 19, Base: 4, Ethereum: 2, etc.). Data structure consistent with frontend expectations."
