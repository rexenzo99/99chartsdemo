The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack web application from scratch based on the user's iterative requirements. Initial challenges included setting up the project structure, resolving API integration issues with Dexscreener (switching from trending to search endpoint due to null responses), and addressing CORS/environment variable issues causing No charts available errors. A significant architectural shift involved moving from Dexscreener to direct TradingView embedding for better customization control, though this proved problematic due to TradingView's embedding restrictions, leading to a reversion to Dexscreener.

The project then focused on core features: a ticker selection screen with auto-population (trending, market cap with extensive filtering), chart interval selection, and a complex multi-phase analysis flow (Hot or Not, Tournament, Results). Key challenges involved ensuring custom settings persisted across charts and accurately feeding selected/randomized tickers into the analysis flow. The AI engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills using *** Unknown syntax: logs,  for API testing, and  for UI verification, including leveraging  for complex network/environment issues. The most recent work involves implementing the tournament UI and ensuring complete anonymity by removing all ticker references for unbiased analysis.

The user initially requested a simple web application featuring a single iframe connected to the Dexscreener API to display the top 30 trending charts. Users should progress through these charts one by one, selecting either a green (bullish) or red (bearish) option. The application must capture these dispositions for later review in a final results summary.

Over time, the product evolved significantly. Key additions include:
1.  **Dark Mode UI**: All elements outside the iframe should be in dark mode.
2.  **Minimalist UI**: Remove all metadata (price, 24h change, progress) outside the iframe, leaving only the chart and voting buttons.
3.  **Square Iframe**: Adjust the iframe to a square aspect ratio.
4.  **Chart Configuration**: A dedicated initial screen allowing users to configure chart settings (timeframe, indicators, etc.) using TradingView's native save functionality, with these settings persisting across all subsequent charts in the session. A specific BTC/USDT chart from Binance was requested for this configuration.
5.  **Ticker Selection Screen**: A new screen for users to manually enter or auto-populate 32 tickers. This includes Top Market Cap (filtered to exclude stablecoins and wrapped tokens like USDTUSDT, USDCUSDT, STETHUSDT, WBTCUSDT, USDEUSDT, BGBUSDT, SUSDEUSDT, etc.) and Trending Search buttons, overwriting existing inputs.
6.  **Chart Interval Selector**: A dropdown in the top right of the ticker selection screen (defaulting to 1 hour) allowing users to select chart timeframes (15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w). This selection should apply to all charts in the analysis.
7.  **Randomized Ticker Analysis**: The 32 selected/auto-populated tickers must be randomized before being fed into the Hot or Not analysis flow.
8.  **Tournament Style (Step 3)**: A side-by-side comparison UI for charts that were voted green in the Hot or Not phase. This tournament should feature anonymous charts (Chart A vs Chart B) to remove bias and implement a double-elimination logic to identify the top 3 charts.
9.  **Results Page (Step 4)**: A wide-screen results page displaying the final tournament rankings.

The application's current state implements Step 1 (User Selection Page), Step 2 (Hot or Not selection flow), and is actively developing Step 3 (The Tournament Style).

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The main FastAPI application. Handles API endpoints for session management, fetching chart data, recording user choices, and retrieving session results.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Initially fetched trending charts from Dexscreener.
        -   Modified to use Dexscreener's search endpoint and later to fetch 32 trending/market cap tokens with specific filtering logic for USDT/USDC pairs.
        -   Logic for handling , , , , .
        -   Hardcoded the  list for filtering market cap tokens.
        -   Added  and  functions.
        -   Removed all references to  related backend logic during the switch back to Dexscreener.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The core React component managing the application's state, UI rendering, and interaction logic.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Initial Build**: Set up basic iframe for Dexscreener, green/red buttons, progress bar.
        -   **UI Refinements**: Applied dark mode, removed metadata (chart info, progress text), adjusted iframe to square aspect ratio, and made buttons circular.
        -   **API Integration**: Manages fetching data from the backend, handling navigation, and submitting user choices.
        -   **Chart Configuration (Temporary)**: Introduced a configuration mode with a BTC/USDT chart and Start App button, later reverted.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the Tournament Style (Step 3) UI and logic. The user provided a mockup for the results page, prompting the AI to start work on the Step 3 UI first.

The current state of the application is as follows:
*   **Ticker Selection Screen (Step 1)**: Fully functional. Users can manually input 32 tickers, auto-populate with Top Market Cap (with specified exclusions like stablecoins/wrapped tokens) or Trending Search (from Dexscreener), and select a chart interval (15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w) defaulting to 1 hour. All inputs overwrite previous values, and the Clear button works. The UI is clean, dark-themed, and responsive.
*   **Hot or Not Selection Flow (Step 2)**: Fully functional. After selecting tickers and an interval, the app transitions to this screen. It loads individual Dexscreener charts based on the selected/randomized tickers (prioritizing USDT/USDC pairs) with the chosen interval. Users vote Bullish or Bearish (green/red buttons), and choices are recorded. The UI is dark, minimalistic, showing only the square iframe and voting buttons, with all metadata removed to ensure unbiased analysis.
*   **Tournament Style (Step 3)**: The UI for this phase has been successfully implemented. It features a head-to-head, side-by-side comparison of two charts, labeled Chart A and Chart B to maintain anonymity (no ticker symbols are displayed). Users can select a winner using Choose This Chart buttons below each iframe. The underlying logic for a double-elimination tournament is in place, tracking winners, losers, and progressing through phases (Winners Bracket, Losers Bracket, Grand Finals) to ultimately determine the top 3 charts. The styling is consistent with the app's dark theme.

The recent conversation indicates the UI for Step 3 is complete and the double elimination logic is in place, ready to receive green choices from the Hot or Not phase.
